<header>Trust remote IP address provided by proxies?</header>

If enabled, Webmin will use a header provided by a proxy to determine the 
browser's real IP address for logging and access control purposes, such 
as <tt>X-Forwarded-For</tt> or <tt>X-Real-IP</tt>. This should <b>only</b> be
enabled when your Webmin system is behind a proxy, and there is no direct
access from clients. Otherwise a fake header could be sent to bypass IP
access control restrictions. <p>
