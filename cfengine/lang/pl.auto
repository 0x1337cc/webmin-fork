type_control_0=The field below lists the actions that are executed when the configuration engine runs, in the order that they will be executed. Actions which are not listed will not be processed, even if they are listed on the main page.
type_control_1=The options below control the global behaviour of the background process that accepts requests to execute the configuration on this host when requested by a remote host, or on a fixed schedule.
type_directories=The directories listed below will be created with the given ownership and permissions when they do not exist. The owner, group and permissions fields are optional.
type_links=The symbolic links listed below will be created where they do not currently exist. If a link already exists but points to a different destination, it will not normally be changed.
type_admit=The configuration engine daemon will only grant access to directory listed below by the hosts listed next to each directory. Hosts can be entered as an IP address, hostname or host pattern (like <tt>*.foo.com</tt>).
type_deny=Directories listed below will be denied access to by the hosts listed next to each directory, even if they are listed in an Allowed directories action. Hosts can be entered as an IP address, hostname or host pattern (like <tt>*.foo.com</tt>).
type_groups=Use the table below to define additional groups of hosts that can be used elsewhere in the configuration as class names. Groups can also contain shell commands in quotes that are executed to determine if the group evaluates to true or false.
type_classes=$type_group
type_copy=Each of the files or directories (and their contents) listed below will be copied to the chosen destination, when necessary. You can also choose to copy from a remote host, as long as that host is running the configuration engine daemon and allows this host to copy files.
type_disable=The files listed below will be checked to see if it exists and meets the selected size and type criteria, and if so disabled by either renaming or truncation.
type_editfiles=The text area below can be used to enter a script that edits the selected file, adding, deleting or updating lines where necessary. For the syntax of this script language, see the full CFengine documentation.
type_ignore=Any files or directories entered below will be ignored by all 'Copy files', 'Set permissions' and 'Tidy up directories' actions. Each entry can be a full path, a shell-style regular expression or a filename.
type_processes=Use the field below to search for processes matching the given pattern, and optionally send them a signal to kill them. When a process is killed, you can also specify a command to be run to restart it.
type_shellcommands=The commands listed below will be executed every time the configuration engine is run. The user and group fields are optional - if nothing is entered, the command will be executed as root. The timeout field is also optional - if no timeout is given, CFengine will wait forever until the command is complete.
type_tidy=The directories listed below will be scanned for files matching the selected name, age and time criteria each time CFengine is run. Any files found will be deleted, with no backup made.
type_miscmounts=NFS filesystem mounts listed below will be checked and mounted if necessary when CFengine is run. The NFS server and path field must be entered in the standard form of <tt>servername:/path/name</tt>. The mount options must be in the same format as used in the <tt>/etc/fstab</tt> file, and are optional.
type_resolve=The DNS server IP addresses that you enter below will be used to update the <tt>/etc/resolv.conf</tt> file when this action is run, by adding lines for any listed nameservers that are not yet in the file.
type_defaultroute=When this action is run, the configuration engine will check the current default route against the gateway specified below.
type_required=The filesystems listed below will be checked when this action is run to verify that they are mounted, and if not a warning message will be displayed. Each filesystem will also be checked to see if its free space has fallen below the set minimum, if any.
