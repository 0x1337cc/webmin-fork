<h3>Filtering chains</h3>

For better collaboration with external iptables scripts you can exclude individual
chains from the processing by the firewall. To do this, you must select direct
processing of rules in the settings and enter a filter list, which excludes
the appropriate chains from processing.
Chains that are not exculded from editing are flagged with a "not managed by firewall" message.

<h3>IP Sets</h3>

Newer versions of ip(6)table support the ipset extension.
IP sets are lists of IP addresses in the main memory, which can be searched very efficiently
and used as a condition in rules. On the main page, existing IP sets that can be used by 
rules are displayed. Currently, however, it is not possible to manage these in the firewall.
