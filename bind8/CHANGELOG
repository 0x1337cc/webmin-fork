---- Changes since 1.130 ----
A new Module Config option is available to define extra DNS record types for the module to support in a generic way. This allows user who want to create obscure types like NAPTR, KEY and so on to do so.
---- Changes since 1.140 ----
Added an ACL option to limit allowed record types.
Views are now added to the file specified in the Module Config, rather than to named.conf.
The file in Module Config for new views and zones is only used if it is included into named.conf.
---- Changes since 1.150 ----
Added a button for selecting a free IP address when adding Address records, and a Module Config page option for entering IP allocation ranges.
Added basic support for delegation-only zones.
Created two new bind8-lib.pl functions for creating and deleting slave zones, for use by remote callers to avoid transferring large amounts of data via RPC calls.
If the rndc command is installed but does not re-load a zone properly, the ndc command will be attempted as well if possible.
---- Changes since 1.160 ----
Added a Module Config option to control whether or not the PID file is under the chroot directory.
---- Changes since 1.180 ----
Added a new display mode for the zones list - an expandable tree categorized by parent domain.
---- Changes since 1.190 ----
Slave zones now display the last date on which they were transferred.
When using date-based SOAs, the starting number for the serial can be specified in the module configuration.
Added button for re-downloading the root zone nameservers, which may occasionally change.
---- Changes since 1.200 ----
Basic information about all domains is now kept in a separate cache file, which can be read faster than the primary named.conf file. This speeds up the zone list and editing of records on systems that have a large number of domains.
More than one slave server to add new master zones to can now be defined, and zones will be added, deleted and applied on all at once. When a slave is added, existing master zones can also be converted to new slave zones on it.
Multiple master, slave or forward zones can now be created at once from a batch file, using a new link on the module's index page.
When a list view is used for zones, several can now be selected at once and deleted using a single button.
---- Changes since 1.210 ----
Added a new page for setting up RNDC on BIND version 9, so that individual zones can be reloaded.
Updated the Control Interface Options to be more consistent with the rest of the module.
Added support for easily creating SPF records. Even though these are really TXT records, they now appear as a separate type in this module.
---- Changes since 1.220 ----
Moved the option for the default nameserver for new master domains to the Zone Defaults page, where it is more obvious.
---- Changes since 1.240 ----
Added a Module Config option for Unix time serial numbers.
Multiple records in a zone can be deleted at once using checkboxes in the records list.
---- Changes since 1.250 ----
When deleting a zone, the .log or .jnl file created by BIND for dynamic DNS updates is also removed.
Added an icon for manually editing the BIND master configuration file.
Reverse IPs are updated even when the forward record names are not fully canonicalized.
Added an ACL option to allow a Webmin user to apply the BIND configuration, but not stop or start the server.
---- Changes since 1.260 ----
When adding a cluster slave DNS server, you can specify that slave zones created locally should also be created on the slave too, with the same settings.
Added a Module Config option to not read or display records in a zone by default, which speeds up the process of adding records to very large zones. Thanks to Walgreens for sponsoring this feature.
When deleting multiple Address records, their corresponding reverse records can be deleted as well.
Cluster slave DNS servers can have an alternative hostname specified, for use in the NS records on the master when a new zone is added.
Added a field on the Addresses and Topology page for controlling which clients can make recursive queries.
When an automatic filename is chosen for a zone added to a view, the view name is included in order to avoid clashes.
---- Changes since 1.270 ----
Added support for the TLS protocol in SRV records.
Added select all / invert links to slave servers list.
---- Changes since 1.300 ----
In the template records file, $IP and $DOM will be substituted with the IP address and domain name when creating a new master zone.
---- Changes since 1.310 ----
Added an option to the master zone creation page to create PTR records for for template A records.
---- Changes since 1.320 ----
Added a button on the main page for updating the values of records in multiple domains at once. Useful for mass IP address changes.
---- Changes since 1.330 ----
Allowed views are now enforced when adding multiple zones from a batch file.
---- Changes since 1.340 ----
Updated the Edit Record form to use ui-lib.pl, for easier theming.
Fixed a bug that can occur when deleting multiple DNS records at once, causing the wrong ones to be removed.
---- Changes since 1.360 ----
Added a button to the main page for adding a record with the same name and value to multiple domains at once.
---- Changes since 1.370 ----
Multiple zones can be deleted and updated when using the icons view.
---- Changes since 1.380 ----
Added buttons for freezing and un-freezing a master zone, for use on systems that also use dynamic DNS. Thanks to Clément Véret for submitting this patch.
When adding a remote slave zone, the IPs of all other slaves and the master are included in the master IPs list.
---- Changes since 1.390 ----
BIND on Windows can now be configured using this module.
Mass record creation can now add records for the domain name (by entering @ as the name), as records that already exist.
---- Changes since 1.400 ----
Keys in ACL sections are no long mangled by Webmin. This means that each IP or key must be entered on a separate line in the Access Control Lists page.
---- Changes since 1.410 ----
Corrected parsing of records in zone files with no names, which inherit from the previous record.
Spaces are now allowed in Host Information records.
---- Changes since 1.420 ----
The default TTL for multiple zones can now be changed on the Update Records in Zones page.
When adding a cluster slave server, multiple views can be entered to have slave zones created in all of them.
Record names or values entered like ns.foo.com in the domain foo.com automatically have a . added to make them absolute as the user presumably expected, rather than being coverted to ns.foo.com.foo.com.
Update serial number (by default) when editing records manually.
Try downloading root zone files from the IP for rs.internic.net if the hostname cannot be resolved, to avoid catch-22 problem.
Access control lists are now automatically re-ordered to handle dependencies.
When Webmin is not automatically converting records to canonical format for editing, display the canonical name on the Edit Record page.
When adding a cluster slave server, allow zones to be created in the same view on the slave as on the master.
