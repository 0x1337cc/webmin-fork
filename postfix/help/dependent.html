<header>Sender dependent addresses</header>

The optional sender dependent addresses file allows the relay host for 
for outgoing SMTP connections to be set on a per-address or per-domain basis. The left
hand side of each entry can be either a full email address like
<tt>foo@bar.com</tt>, or just a domain like <tt>@bar.com</tt>. The right hand
side must be the hostname or IP address of a mail server to relay mail though.
